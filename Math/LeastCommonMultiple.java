/*
Problem Description
Write a program to input an integer T and then for each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines and then print T lines containing Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given 2 numbers A and B.
LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both.

Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= A,B <= 1000

Input Format
The first line contains T which means number of test cases.
Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase.
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.

Output Format
T lines each containing an integer representing LCM of A & B.

Example Input
Input 1:
3
2
3
9
6
2
6

Example Output
Output 1:
6
18
6

Example Explanation
Explanation:
 In first testcase 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
 In second testcase 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
 In third testcase  6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).
